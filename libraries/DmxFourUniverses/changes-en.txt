Deskontrol 4 universes DMX library for Arduino.


Version 0.3 

CHANGES


- Not needed anymore to disable and enable interrupts during configuration.


- Not needed anymore to modify the Arduino IDE file HarwareSerial.cpp.


- Experimental support for non-standard DMX modes, faster and with more channels per universe:

	
DMX512  (250 kbaud  - 2 to 512  channels) Standard USITT DMX-512
	
DMX1024 (500 kbaud  - 2 to 1024 channels) Completely non standard - TESTED ok
	
DMX2048 (1000 kbaud - 2 to 2048 channels) called by Manufacturers DMX1000K, 4x DMX or DMX 1M ???


- Removed leds tx - rx for speedup, if required shall be implemented in the program


- Interrupts on frame transmitted and frame received by each universe, user callback functions.




Known issues:


When we compile get the error: 'ArduinoDmxN' was not Declared In This scope:


Check if you have configured the correct type of board in the Arduino IDE, menu tools > board
(with Arduino nano can only use one USART = ArduinoDmx0 = USART0)




Flicker when controlling LEDs:


If we are dealing with LED lights, flicker may appear due to a refresh rate too low, we use fewer channels per universe (eg 200 instead of 512, to increase the frequency) and / or use less universes.




Note about the refresh time:


The Arduino Mega and Arduino Nano use a microcontroller Atmel AVR 8-bit at 16 Mhz, which imposes a limitation of resources. 
For example, 4 buffers in DMX1000K mode at 2048 channels each, will consume ALL the memory on an Arduino Mega 2560, so it must be clear what we are doing.
We should note that in practice we will probably not use all universes with all channels if we keep up the refresh rate of the DMX inputs and outputs. 

Any suggestions or improvements are welcome.
